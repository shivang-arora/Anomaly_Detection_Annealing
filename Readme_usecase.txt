 Anomaly Detection with Quantum Annealing

- [x] The jupyter notebook 'Use_case_annealing' provides a way to do Anomaly Detection in an unsupervised manner 
with a Quantum Boltzmann Machine (RBM).




### Helper functions and python script for Use case demonstration.

 The following python scripts contain helper functions and visualization tools for the use case demonstration. They are added in the 'src' repository.

	-[x] drawer.py
	-[x] helper.py
	-[x] visualizer.py

# Pre-Loaded Datasets and Model weights

The sub repositories 'datasets' and 'models' contain the dataset and the final model weights for simulated annealing.

 



### Restricted Boltzman Machine

There are two files "classical_main.py" and "quantum_main.py" they will run either the classic or
the quantum approach. Some values can be changed to reconfigure the implementations, this is rather
straightforward and the code is documented so this explanation ends here.
